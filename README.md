## Description ##
Recreating a calculator and its basic functionality using Javascript. 

## Thoughts and Takeaways  ##
Like Etch-A-Sketch, I tried initially creating the calculator using Flexbox but ran into a lot of troubles when it came to styling and layout. Refactored my code to use CSS grid. From this, I felt a lot more comfortable on when to use CSS grid or flexboxs. The calculator evaluates a single pair of numbers at a time and does not follow BEDMAS order of operations
